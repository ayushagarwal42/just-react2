for studying states we have to study hooks also
hooks were a new addition in react 16.8 till this we have 10 hooks
they let u use state and other react features without writing a class
before hooks we render by making class components
but now we use functional components
but now in 18th version 5 more hooks added so total 15 hooks are there now.

1st basic hook is -> usestate
it lets you add a state variable to your component

const [state,setState]=useState(initialState);
useState returns an array with exactly 2 values
1.The current state. During the 1st render, it will match the initialState you have passed.
2.The set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re render

for ex 
initialState=0
state=count
setState

closure:A closure is a feature in js where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) functions variables
